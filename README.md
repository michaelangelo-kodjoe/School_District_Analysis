# School_District_Analysis
Analyzing school districts and their performance using Python Pandas

## Overview Of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to replace the inaccurate data for the 9th graders who went to Thomas High School while keeping the rest of the data and perform the same analysis that was done in the earlier analysis found in the PyCitySchools notebook . The metrics that we want to analyze our data by include: total school budget, per student capita, average math and reading score, the passing percent for math and reading, and the overall passing percentage.

## Results Of The Analysis
The metrics from the original analysis made remained the same. This is feasible because of the large data set given, and removing only a small portion of the data (math and reading scores for 9th graders at Thomas High School) would not change the data drastically. Below is the table from the original analysis, which includes the math and reading scores for 9th graders at Thomas High School.

* You can see above that the the Average Math Score was affected slightly by a .01 margin which is very negligible.
* The percentage of people passing math and reading were also slightly affected by a .02 and .03 margin respectively.

The following table is from the most recent analysis, where the math and reading scores for 9th graders at Thomas High School was removed. We can see that the only differences are the averages and percent passing at Thomas High School. Even with the removal of certain data, the overall results remained fairly the same.
